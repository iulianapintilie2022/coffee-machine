❤️❤️ Small mini game in the console taking input - Coffee Machine from Hyperskill ❤️❤️

This machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. 
And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup. You can fill the machine with ingredients, use it for a coffee or take the money from it. ☕️💵
